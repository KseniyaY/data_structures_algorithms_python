"""
You should become comfortable with various graph representationsâ€”graphs
crop up often in interviews and in computer science in general,
and you could need to represent it in any of it's forms.

In this exercise you'll need to add functions to a Graph class
to return various representations of the same graph.
Your graph will have two different components: Nodes and Edges.
A Graph class contains a list of nodes and edges. You can sometimes get by with
just a list of edges, since edges contain references to the nodes they connect to,
or vice versa. However, our Graph class is built with both for the following reasons:

If you're storing a disconnected graph, not every node will be tied to an edge,
so you should store a list of nodes.
We could probably leave it there, but storing an edge list will make our lives
much easier when we're trying to print out different types of graph representations.
Unfortunately, having both makes insertion a bit complicated.
We can assume that each value is unique, but we need to be careful about
keeping both nodes and edges updated when either is inserted.
You'll also be given these insertion functions to help you out:
